## _The enemy of the Bash exams_

# History 📕
So basically, I created this project to be a way to share codes with my classmates,  we had Bash classes at the school so was interesting to have a way to share the code, and I was the only one who knows how to do something useful. I used this project to post my answers to the exams and the exercises, so my classmates could see what i did and copy it. I deployed it in Heroku (when it had the free tier plan 😢), this was very useful at that moment, but now I don't know what to do with it, so I'm posting this here.

# Tec ⚙️
I used ruby on rails in this project, that was the fastest way to create a "blog" for my codes, [hilightjs](https://highlightjs.org/) to show the code and [simplecss](https://simplecss.org/) for the styling.
